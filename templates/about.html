  The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in
  Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in recapturing his long lost family
  inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when
  Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous
  Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their
  company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
  Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes
  prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The superstitious Dwarves also
  considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to
  leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

    <h3>Theorin Oakenshield</h3>
    <p>
      Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to the Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of
      the Lonely Mountain. Early in his youth, Thorin and the other Dwarves of
      the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug, in TA 2770.
      While in exile, he quickly grew into a capable warrior. This was
      demonstrated at the Battle of Azanulbizar, near Moria, in TA 2799. He
      fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath Moria's East-gate, and at
      some point in the battle, his shield broke, and, using an oaken tree
      branch found on the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet
      "Oakenshield," which remained with him even in death.

    <h3>Fili and Kili</h3>
    <p>
      Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their
      mother, Dís. They were also nephews of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and
      great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his long
      nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.

    <h3>Óin</h3>
    <p>
      Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle
      of Gimli. Óin's uncle was Fundin, the father of Balin and Dwalin. Óin
      fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in
      TA 2941 joined Thorin's company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely
      Mountain, wearing a brown hood.

    <h3>Gloin</h3>
    <p>
      Glóin was born in TA 2783, after the dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. He was
      the younger child of Gróin and younger brother of Óin. In TA 2799, Glóin
      was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of
      the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, though it is unknown how significant his
      contribution was, being 16 years old.

    <h3>Balin</h3>
    <p>
      Balin was likely born in the Lonely Mountain before the coming of the
      dragon Smaug. He had a younger brother named Dwalin, and was amongst those
      driven from their homes when Smaug attacked the Lonely Mountain.
      Afterwards, he may have lived in Dunland as a refugee, before fighting in
      the War of the Dwarves and Orcs which culminated in the Battle of
      Azanulbizar. Many years later, in approximately TA 2841, he accompanied
      Thráin II, the father of Thorin, when he attempted to go back to the
      Lonely Mountain himself, but Thráin was captured and lost.
